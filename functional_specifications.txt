Overview weClick is a service that allows students to take in class quizzes on the web. 
 
Scenarios 
 
Scenario 1: Sam 
Sam is a teacher that wants quick feedback in class to see how well students are following the lectures. He decides to do a quick survey in class and lets students see how well they are doing. He uses weClick to do this.  
 
Students go to the quiz page he provides them, while Sam goes to the admin page. Sam begins the quiz by posting a question in his powerpoint and starts the timer. The students make their selection on their devices. He then stops the timer. He clicks on the results button and displays a bar chart of the number of responses received for each input. He resets and refreshes the page for another question.
